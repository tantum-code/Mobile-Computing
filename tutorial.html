				The main goal is to find a set of randomly palced vocabs/flashcards on a map. You can upload your own Vocabularies (.csv or .txt file)
				and place them within a certain radius around your location. Your goal is to reach the destinations marked on your map.
				If you know the right answer, the location-marker will disappear, if not, you must try again.
				The game is finished once all Locations were found and all vocabs have been solved correctly.<br>
				<br>

				In order to play, navigate to the "Start" page on the Navigation Menu. When on 
				the Start page, start setting up your game by:
				<ul>
					<li>Load a CSV or txt File into the File-input prompt</li>
					<li>Enter a search-radius into the Text-input</li>
					<li>Press the "Place" button and wait for the map to update</li>
				</ul>
				You can always re-navigate to the Start page to place more vocabs on your map.
				If you want to get rid of the Game-menu, you can navigate to the "Map" section on the Nagivation Menu
				in order to hide the Settings.
